          I am Soraya Partow, a Principal Software Engineer
          and an M.S. Computer Science student at {site.affiliation}. My work
          sits at the intersection of AI alignment, multi-agent systems, and
          the engineering practices required to deploy autonomous systems
          responsibly at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past decade I have led engineering efforts at{" "}
          Expedia Group, Dell EMC, and{" "}
          Microsoft, spanning large-scale distributed systems,
          cloud infrastructure, and ML-supported platforms. That experience
          shapes how I approach research: I am interested in alignment,
          evaluation, and governance questions that must survive contact with
          production — distribution shift, adversarial pressure, organizational
          constraints, and imperfect human oversight.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current graduate research develops VAST (Values
          Alignment &amp; Stability Tracker), a framework for
          monitoring moral drift in autonomous agents, and a blockchain-backed
          extension that makes AI governance independently auditable. In
          parallel, I study grader reliability and{" "}
          reward manipulation in RLHF-style pipelines, and
          behavioral game-theoretic defenses for IoT and hardware security.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am preparing to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science focused on
          trustworthy autonomous systems. I am particularly drawn to problems
          where formal guarantees, empirical evaluation, and real deployment
          conditions must be reconciled — and where research contributions can
          translate into safer systems for people who never see the code.
